## Enhancement Plan

### üéØ Priority 1: Critical for Professional Use

These features are **essential** for matching professional SQL editor expectations. Their absence is noticeable to experienced SQL developers.

#### 1. Table Alias Support

**Description:** Recognize and track table aliases to enable alias-prefixed column suggestions.

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Should work:
SELECT u.id, u.name FROM users u
SELECT c.name, o.total FROM customers c JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
SELECT u.* FROM users u WHERE u.active = true
```

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Parse table aliases after FROM and JOIN clauses
- Track alias‚Üítable mapping in suggestion context
- Detect alias prefix before dot (e.g., `u.`)
- Filter column suggestions to show only columns from the aliased table
- Support multiple aliases simultaneously
- Handle alias in WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING clauses

**Test Coverage to Add:**
- Alias detection after FROM clause (3 tests)
- Alias detection after JOIN clauses (3 tests)
- Column suggestions with alias prefix (4 tests)
- Multi-table alias tracking (3 tests)
- Alias in WHERE/GROUP BY/ORDER BY (2 tests)

**Total: ~15 new tests**

**Complexity:** Medium

---

#### 2. Single Quote Support

**Description:** Add support for single-quoted identifiers and string literals, following SQL standard.

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Should work:
WHERE name = 'John'
SELECT 'Column Name' as col
INSERT INTO users ('First Name', 'Last Name') VALUES (...)
```

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Extend quote detection to include single quotes `'`
- Handle escape sequences (`''` for literal quote)
- Distinguish between identifier quotes and string literals based on context
- Update `stringWithoutQuotes` extension to handle all three quote types
- Support mixed quoting styles in same query

**Test Coverage to Add:**
- Single-quoted identifier detection (3 tests)

- Escape handling (2 tests)

**Total: ~8 new tests**

**Complexity:** Low-Medium

---

#### 3. Subquery Context Awareness

**Description:** Recognize subqueries and provide appropriate suggestions within nested SELECT statements.

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Should work:
SELECT * FROM (SELECT id, name FROM users) subq
SELECT u.name FROM (SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = true) u
WITH temp AS (SELECT id FROM users) SELECT * FROM temp
```

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Detect nested SELECT statements (parenthesized queries)
- Track nesting level and context
- Provide column suggestions based on subquery columns
- Support subquery aliases
- Handle multiple levels of nesting
- Integrate with CTE (WITH clause) detection

**Test Coverage to Add:**

- Column suggestions within subqueries (3 tests)
- Multi-level nesting (3 tests)

**Total: ~12 new tests**

**Complexity:** High

---

#### 4. JOIN ON Column Matching

**Description:** Intelligently suggest matching columns when typing JOIN ON clauses.

```sql
-- After typing "JOIN orders ON users."
-- Should suggest: id, customer_id, user_id (likely foreign keys)

JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
LEFT JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
```

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Detect ON clause context
- Identify tables involved in the JOIN
- Suggest columns from appropriate table after dot
- Prioritize columns with similar names (foreign key patterns)
- Support multi-column JOIN conditions
- Handle table aliases in ON clause

**Test Coverage to Add:**

### ‚≠ê Priority 2: Nice-to-Have Professional Features

These features enhance the editor for **advanced use cases** but aren't critical for basic professional work.

#### 5. CTE (Common Table Expressions) Support

**Description:** Support WITH clause for temporary named result sets.

**Examples:**
```sql
WITH user_totals AS (
  SELECT user_id, SUM(amount) as total
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT u.name, ut.total
FROM users u
JOIN user_totals ut ON u.id = ut.user_id
```

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Detect WITH clause
- Track CTE names and their columns

ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC)
SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
```

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Detect window function context
- Suggest OVER clause after window functions
- Provide PARTITION BY and ORDER BY suggestions

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Organization

Each new feature should follow the existing pattern:

1. **Feature Detection Logic**
   - Add detection methods in `SuggestionHelper`
   - Keep methods focused and testable

2. **Insertion Logic**
   - Extend `WordInsertionHelper` for replacement behavior
   - Maintain existing multi-word and quote handling patterns

3. **Test Coverage**
   - Create feature-specific test groups
   - Follow existing test structure (setUp, tearDown, clear test names)
   - Aim for 100% code coverage of new logic

4. **Documentation**
   - Update WORD_INSERTION.md with new examples
   - Document edge cases and limitations
   - Add integration notes for consumers

### Testing Strategy

For each new feature:

1. **Unit Tests** - Test detection logic in isolation
2. **Integration Tests** - Test full insertion flow
3. **Edge Case Tests** - Cover unusual inputs and SQL patterns
4. **Performance Tests** - Ensure no regression in suggestion speed

### Backward Compatibility

All enhancements should:
- Maintain existing API contracts
- Not break current functionality
- Degrade gracefully when schema info unavailable
- Support incremental adoption

---

## Success Metrics

### After Option B Implementation

**Quantitative:**
- Test coverage: 113+ tests (up from 68)
- Code coverage: Maintain >90% for new code

**Qualitative:**
- Users can write complex multi-table queries efficiently
- Alias-based suggestions feel natural and intuitive
- JOIN ON suggestions reduce typing by ~40% in complex queries
- Subquery support enables advanced query patterns

### User Satisfaction Goals

- Reduce "why doesn't this work?" moments by 80%
- Increase perceived editor quality from "good" to "excellent"
- Match or exceed expectations from professional SQL tools
- Enable users to write production queries without switching editors

**Total Estimated Time:** 10-14 days

---

## Conclusion

The current SQL editor implementation is **already very good** (7.5/10) with world-class features in multi-word handling, function autocomplete, and cross-platform support.

**Option B enhancements** would elevate it to **professional-grade** (8.5/10), addressing the critical gaps that experienced SQL developers notice daily.

This roadmap provides a clear path to becoming a **go-to SQL editing solution** while maintaining the excellent foundation already in place.
