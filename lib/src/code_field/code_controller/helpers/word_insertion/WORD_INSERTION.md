# Word Insertion Helper Implementation

## Overview

The `WordInsertionHelper` class is responsible for handling the insertion of autocomplete suggestions into the code editor. It provides a clean, encapsulated way to manage the logic of replacing text with selected suggestions while maintaining proper cursor positioning and formatting.

## Key Components

1. **Context-Aware Insertion Logic**
   - Intelligently determines which text to replace based on context
   - Handles SQL-specific scenarios like field names after clauses
   - Detects and properly replaces multi-word identifiers
   - Maintains SQL syntax awareness for better replacements

2. **SQL-Specific Text Replacement**
   - Recognizes SQL clauses (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc.)
   - Handles field names with spaces in SQL queries
   - Properly replaces complete phrases like "order da" with "Order Date"
   - Preserves SQL query structure during replacements

3. **Multi-Word Identifier Handling**
   - Intelligently determines the start position for multi-word phrases
   - Handles quoted identifiers containing spaces
   - Supports replacing complete phrases rather than just parts 
   - Uses token comparison to ensure accurate replacements

4. **SQL Aggregation Function Support**
   - Automatically adds parentheses to functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT
   - Positions cursor inside the parentheses for immediate parameter entry
   - Detects context to only add parentheses in SQL contexts
   - Supports common aggregation functions like MIN, MAX, MEDIAN, etc.

5. **Quoted Identifier Support**
   - Properly handles identifiers with double quotes (`"Column Name"`)
   - Supports backtick-quoted identifiers (`` `Column Name` ``)
   - Uses `stringWithoutQuotes` for quote-agnostic comparisons
   - Tries multiple quoting styles when searching for identifiers

6. **Formatting Integration**
   - Works with the `SqlFormatter` to format inserted text properly
   - Handles quoting and SQL syntax requirements
   - Ensures consistent formatting throughout the document

7. **Cursor Positioning**
   - Places the cursor at the appropriate position after insertion
   - Handles cases like function calls with parameters
   - Positions cursor inside aggregation function parentheses
   - Ensures a smooth editing experience

## Process Flow

1. **Identifying Replacement Range**
   - Determine where the selected suggestion should be inserted
   - For multi-word fields, find the true start position
   - Use SQL context awareness to determine full phrase boundaries

2. **Special Case: SQL Context Detection**
   - Detect SQL context by finding keywords like SELECT, FROM, etc.
   - Find the preceding SQL clause to determine context
   - For table/column names, handle quoting and formatting
   - Identify SQL aggregation functions for special handling

3. **Quote-Aware Text Processing**
   - Use `stringWithoutQuotes` for comparing identifiers
   - Try multiple quoting styles when searching for phrases
   - Support identifier matching regardless of quote style
   - Properly handle both quoted and unquoted columns

4. **Function-Aware Text Processing**
   - Detect SQL aggregation functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT
   - Automatically append parentheses to function names
   - Adjust cursor positioning to facilitate parameter entry
   - Support common SQL aggregation functions

5. **Text Replacement**
   - Replace the identified text range with the formatted suggestion
   - Format the text according to SQL rules if needed
   - Position the cursor after the inserted text or inside parentheses
   - Add function-specific syntax elements as needed

6. **Post-Insertion Actions**
   - Show column suggestions if a table name was inserted
   - Handle function call insertion specially
   - Hide the suggestion popup in other cases

## Multi-Word Field Handling

The WordInsertionHelper includes sophisticated logic for handling multi-word fields, particularly in SQL contexts:

1. **SQL Context Detection**
   - Identifies when text is being edited in an SQL query
   - Detects SQL clauses like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc.
   - Adjusts behavior based on clause type

2. **Field Name Recognition**
   - Distinguishes between SQL keywords and field names
   - Identifies multi-word field names after SQL clauses
   - Detects partial typing of multi-word fields
   - Handles quoted field names with `"` or `` ` `` characters

3. **Token-Based Analysis**
   - Compares tokens in both the typed text and suggestion
   - Identifies partial matches in multi-word fields
   - Determines appropriate replacement boundaries
   - Uses quote-agnostic comparison for proper matching

4. **Special Cases**
   - Handles cases like "SELECT order da" → "SELECT Order Date"
   - Properly replaces multi-word field names after clauses
   - Maintains SQL syntax correctness during replacements
   - Supports quoted identifiers like "SELECT `First na`" → "SELECT `First Name`"

## Example Scenarios

1. **Basic Word Replacement:**
   - User types: "SEL"
   - Suggestion: "SELECT"
   - Result: "SELECT" replaces "SEL"

2. **SQL Keyword Replacement:**
   - User types: "INNER JO"
   - Suggestion: "INNER JOIN"
   - Result: Entire "INNER JO" is replaced with "INNER JOIN"

3. **Multi-Word Field After Clause:**
   - User types: "SELECT order da"
   - Suggestion: "Order Date"
   - Result: Entire "order da" is replaced with "Order Date"

4. **Quoted Column Name Handling:**
   - User types: "SELECT `customer na`"
   - Suggestion: "`Customer Name`"
   - Result: Entire "`customer na`" is replaced with "`Customer Name`"

5. **Double-Quoted Identifier Handling:**
   - User types: 'SELECT "first na"'
   - Suggestion: '"First Name"'
   - Result: Entire '"first na"' is replaced with '"First Name"'

6. **SQL Aggregation Function:**
   - User types: "SELECT SU"
   - Suggestion: "SUM"
   - Result: "SUM()" with cursor positioned inside the parentheses

## Integration with Controller

The `WordInsertionHelper` is initialized within the `CodeController` and takes a reference to it. This allows it to:

1. Access the current text and selection
2. Update the text and cursor position
3. Control the suggestion popup's visibility
4. Interact with formatting components

## Design Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Isolates word insertion logic from the main controller
   - Makes the insertion algorithm more testable and maintainable

2. **Improved User Experience**
   - More accurate replacements, especially for multi-word phrases
   - Better handling of SQL-specific syntax and quoted identifiers
   - Automated function parentheses addition saves keystrokes
   - Smoother editing experience for complex code

3. **Context Awareness**
   - SQL syntax awareness improves suggestion relevance
   - Better handling of complex identifiers and quoted strings
   - Function-aware insertion reduces manual typing
   - More intelligent cursor positioning

This helper is a key component in providing a rich autocompletion experience for SQL and other languages in the Flutter Code Editor.
