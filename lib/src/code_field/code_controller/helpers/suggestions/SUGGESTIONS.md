# Suggestion Helper Implementation

## Overview

The `SuggestionHelper` class is responsible for generating code completion suggestions in the Flutter Code Editor. It handles both standard text-based suggestions and context-aware SQL suggestions, providing intelligent autocompletion based on the current cursor position and context.

## Key Components

1. **Table and Column Awareness**
   - Detects when the cursor is after a table name followed by a dot (e.g., `tableName.`)
   - Shows relevant column suggestions for the detected table
   - Filters column suggestions based on what the user has already typed

2. **SQL Context Detection**
   - Identifies the current SQL context (tables referenced in FROM/JOIN clauses)
   - Provides relevant suggestions based on the detected context
   - Handles quoted identifiers and complex table references

3. **Smart Word Matching Algorithm**
   - Uses a word boundary-aware approach to identify complete words at cursor position
   - Prioritizes complete word suggestions over partial matches
   - Prevents partial word replacements (e.g., replacing just "nd" in "and" with a suggestion)
   - Considers various letter case combinations (lowercase, uppercase, title case)
   - Falls back to word-boundary-only matches when no direct word matches are found

4. **Integration with PopupController**
   - Manages when and where to display the suggestion popup
   - Controls the content and filtering of suggestions
   - Handles popup visibility based on context

## Process Flow

1. **Triggering Suggestions**
   - When text changes, the `generateSuggestions` method is called
   - It analyzes the text before the cursor to determine context

2. **Table/Column Detection**
   - If a dot is found, attempt to extract the table name before it
   - If it's a valid table, determine if we need to show all columns or filter them

3. **Context Fallback**
   - If no dot is found, try to detect the SQL context from FROM/JOIN clauses
   - Set the detected table as context for future suggestions

4. **Word Boundary Analysis**
   - First find the complete word at the current cursor position
   - Generate suggestions for the complete word if possible
   - Only fall back to partial matches at proper word boundaries, never mid-word
   - Maintain word integrity for replacement operations

5. **Displaying Suggestions**
   - Show the popup with relevant suggestions
   - Hide the popup if no valid suggestions are found

## Word Matching Logic

The suggestion system uses a sophisticated word matching algorithm that:

1. **Identifies Complete Words**
   - Detects word boundaries using spaces, punctuation, and operators
   - Extracts the complete word where the cursor is positioned
   - Prevents suggestions from replacing only parts of words

2. **Prioritized Matching Hierarchy**
   - First attempts to match the complete word at cursor position
   - Next checks spaces within multi-word phrases
   - Then looks for matches at proper word boundaries
   - Sorts matches by length, preferring longer matches

3. **Fallback Safety Mechanism**
   - Even when no suggestions are found, tracks the complete word
   - Ensures the entire word is replaced, not just parts of it
   - Maintains contextual awareness for table/column detection

## Integration with CodeController

The `SuggestionHelper` is initialized within the `CodeController` and takes a reference to it. This allows it to:

1. Access the current text and cursor position
2. Use the `autocompleter` and `popupController` to generate and display suggestions
3. Track the context between suggestion generations

## Design Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Isolates suggestion logic from the main controller
   - Makes the suggestion algorithm more testable and maintainable

2. **Extensibility**
   - Easy to add support for new languages or suggestion types
   - Can be extended to support more complex SQL analysis

3. **Improved Usability**
   - Natural word-aware suggestions that respect word boundaries
   - Prevents unexpected partial word replacements
   - Better handling of multi-word phrases and expressions

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Focused, targeted suggestions minimize processing overhead
   - Smart caching of word positions and boundaries

## Future Extensions

1. **Enhanced SQL Schema Awareness**
   - Support for more complex schema relationships
   - Better handling of aliases and subqueries

2. **Language-specific Suggestions**
   - Add specialized suggestions for different languages
   - Support for language-specific syntax and idioms

3. **Learning from User Input**
   - Track frequently used completions
   - Prioritize suggestions based on user behavior
