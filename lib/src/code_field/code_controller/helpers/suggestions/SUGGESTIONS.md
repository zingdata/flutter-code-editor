# Suggestion Helper Implementation

## Overview

The `SuggestionHelper` class is responsible for generating code completion suggestions in the Flutter Code Editor. It handles both standard text-based suggestions and context-aware SQL suggestions, providing intelligent autocompletion based on the current cursor position and context.

## Key Components

1. **Table and Column Awareness**
   - Detects when the cursor is after a table name followed by a dot (e.g., `tableName.`)
   - Shows relevant column suggestions for the detected table
   - Filters column suggestions based on what the user has already typed

2. **SQL Context Detection**
   - Identifies the current SQL context (tables referenced in FROM/JOIN clauses)
   - Provides relevant suggestions based on the detected context
   - Handles quoted identifiers and complex table references

3. **Smart Word Matching Algorithm**
   - Uses a word boundary-aware approach to identify complete words at cursor position
   - Prioritizes complete word suggestions over partial matches
   - Prevents partial word replacements (e.g., replacing just "nd" in "and" with a suggestion)
   - Considers various letter case combinations (lowercase, uppercase, title case)
   - Falls back to word-boundary-only matches when no direct word matches are found

4. **Multi-Word Field Support**
   - Identifies and processes multi-word fields (e.g., "Customer Name", "Order Date")
   - Supports matching against individual tokens within multi-word identifiers
   - Allows matching "Name" to suggest "Customer Name" when appropriate
   - Performs comprehensive scanning to find the start of multi-word phrases
   - Handles quoted multi-word identifiers properly (e.g., "First Name", 'Total Amount')

5. **Off-Main-Thread Processing**
   - Performs computationally intensive suggestion operations in a separate Dart isolate
   - Prevents UI freezes during complex suggestion generation
   - Includes graceful fallbacks to main thread if isolate communication fails
   - Automatically manages isolate lifecycle (creation and disposal)

6. **Integration with PopupController**
   - Manages when and where to display the suggestion popup
   - Controls the content and filtering of suggestions
   - Handles popup visibility based on context

## Process Flow

1. **Triggering Suggestions**
   - When text changes, the `generateSuggestions` method is called
   - It analyzes the text before the cursor to determine context

2. **Table/Column Detection**
   - If a dot is found, attempt to extract the table name before it
   - If it's a valid table, determine if we need to show all columns or filter them

3. **Context Fallback**
   - If no dot is found, try to detect the SQL context from FROM/JOIN clauses
   - Set the detected table as context for future suggestions

4. **Word Boundary and Multi-Word Analysis (Off-Main-Thread)**
   - The text analysis is delegated to a background isolate
   - First find the complete word at the current cursor position
   - For multi-word fields, identify potential phrases by looking backward from cursor
   - Generate suggestions for the complete word/phrase if possible
   - If no direct matches, look for token-based matches within multi-word identifiers
   - Only fall back to partial matches at proper word boundaries, never mid-word
   - Maintain word integrity for replacement operations

5. **Displaying Suggestions**
   - Results from the isolate are received back on the main thread
   - Show the popup with relevant suggestions
   - Hide the popup if no valid suggestions are found

## Off-Main-Thread Implementation

The suggestion system uses Dart isolates to move heavy computation off the main thread:

1. **Isolate Communication**
   - Uses a persistent isolate for suggestion operations
   - Communicates through message passing with typed request/response objects
   - Maintains a cached send port for efficient communication

2. **Parallel Processing**
   - The main text analysis and suggestion filtering occurs in parallel
   - Word boundary detection and prefix matching happen in the background
   - Only UI operations (showing/hiding the popup) run on the main thread

3. **Graceful Degradation**
   - If isolate creation or communication fails, automatically falls back to main thread
   - Preserves all functionality even in environments where isolates aren't available
   - Ensures suggestion quality isn't compromised even in fallback mode

4. **Resource Management**
   - Isolate is properly disposed when the controller is disposed
   - Handles edge cases like rapid suggestion requests
   - Uses a single persistent isolate to avoid creation overhead

## Word Matching Logic

The suggestion system uses a sophisticated word matching algorithm that:

1. **Identifies Complete Words**
   - Detects word boundaries using spaces, punctuation, and operators
   - Extracts the complete word where the cursor is positioned
   - Prevents suggestions from replacing only parts of words

2. **Multi-Word Phrase Detection**
   - Scans backward to identify the start of multi-word phrases
   - Handles quoted identifiers and complex SQL structures
   - Recognizes field names with spaces (e.g., "Customer Name")
   - Properly extracts complete phrases for matching

3. **Token-Based Matching**
   - For multi-word identifiers, checks each token against the input
   - Allows typing "Name" to get "Customer Name" as a suggestion
   - Provides more natural suggestions for multi-word fields
   - Intelligently prioritizes matches based on token position and relevance

4. **Prioritized Matching Hierarchy**
   - First attempts to match the complete word at cursor position
   - Next tries to match complete phrases starting before the cursor
   - Then looks for token matches within multi-word identifiers
   - Falls back to looking at spaces within the current word
   - Finally checks for matches at proper word boundaries
   - Sorts matches by priority and length, preferring more relevant matches

5. **Fallback Safety Mechanism**
   - Even when no suggestions are found, tracks the complete word
   - Ensures the entire word is replaced, not just parts of it
   - Maintains contextual awareness for table/column detection

## Integration with CodeController

The `SuggestionHelper` is initialized within the `CodeController` and takes a reference to it. This allows it to:

1. Access the current text and cursor position
2. Use the `autocompleter` and `popupController` to generate and display suggestions
3. Track the context between suggestion generations

## Design Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Isolates suggestion logic from the main controller
   - Makes the suggestion algorithm more testable and maintainable

2. **Extensibility**
   - Easy to add support for new languages or suggestion types
   - Can be extended to support more complex SQL analysis

3. **Improved Usability**
   - Natural word-aware suggestions that respect word boundaries
   - Prevents unexpected partial word replacements
   - Better handling of multi-word phrases and expressions
   - Intelligently suggests complete identifiers from partial input

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Offloads computationally intensive operations to background threads
   - Ensures UI responsiveness even with large suggestion sets
   - Smart caching of word positions and boundaries
   - Persistent isolate reduces startup overhead

## Future Extensions

1. **Enhanced SQL Schema Awareness**
   - Support for more complex schema relationships
   - Better handling of aliases and subqueries

2. **Language-specific Suggestions**
   - Add specialized suggestions for different languages
   - Support for language-specific syntax and idioms

3. **Learning from User Input**
   - Track frequently used completions
   - Prioritize suggestions based on user behavior

4. **Further Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement batched suggestion requests
   - Fine-tune isolate communication for minimal latency
   - Add adaptive processing based on suggestion complexity
