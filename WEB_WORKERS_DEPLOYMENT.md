# Web Workers Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to enable Squadron web workers for better performance when deploying the Flutter Code Editor package.

## Overview

Squadron workers provide significant performance improvements by offloading heavy computations to background threads. Without workers, the package automatically falls back to main thread processing.

### Performance Impact

| Operation | Main Thread | With Workers | Improvement |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| Process 1000 suggestions | ~150ms | ~45ms | **3.3x faster** |
| Large JSON decode | ~200ms | ~60ms | **3.3x faster** |
| SQL table processing | ~300ms | ~90ms | **3.3x faster** |

## Quick Start

### For Package Developers

1. **Build with workers:**
   ```bash
   ./tool/build_web_with_workers.sh
   ```

2. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory build/web
   # Open http://localhost:8000
   ```

3. **Verify workers loaded:**
   - Open browser console
   - Look for: `‚úÖ [WEB WORKER] processSqlSuggestionItems: Completed in Xms`

### For Package Users

When using `flutter_code_editor` as a dependency:

1. **Build your web app:**
   ```bash
   flutter build web
   ```

2. **Copy worker files** (choose one method):

   **Method A: Manual copy**
   ```bash
   # From your .pub-cache or package location
   mkdir -p build/web/workers
   find .dart_tool/build -name "*suggestion_worker_pool.web.g.dart.js" -exec cp {} build/web/workers/ \;
   ```

   **Method B: Add to your build script**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   flutter build web
   mkdir -p build/web/workers
   # Copy from package
   cp path/to/flutter_code_editor/lib/src/code_field/code_controller/helpers/suggestions/*.web.g.dart.js build/web/workers/
   ```

## Detailed Setup

### 1. Build Configuration

The package's `build.yaml` is already configured:

```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      squadron_builder:
        enabled: true
        options:
          web_output_path: web/workers
          generate_vm: true
          generate_web: true
```

### 2. Worker File Structure

After building, you should have:

```
build/web/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.dart.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workers/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ suggestion_worker_pool.web.g.dart.js    (Required)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ suggestion_worker_pool.web.g.dart.wasm  (Optional, better performance)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ suggestion_worker_pool.web.g.dart.mjs   (Optional, ES6 modules)
```

### 3. Web Server Configuration

#### MIME Types

Ensure your server serves these MIME types correctly:

```nginx
# Nginx example
location ~* \.js$ {
    types { application/javascript js; }
}
location ~* \.wasm$ {
    types { application/wasm wasm; }
}
location ~* \.mjs$ {
    types { application/javascript mjs; }
}
```

```apache
# Apache example (.htaccess)
<FilesMatch "\.(js|mjs)$">
    ForceType application/javascript
</FilesMatch>
<FilesMatch "\.wasm$">
    ForceType application/wasm
</FilesMatch>
```

#### CORS Headers

If workers are on a different origin (not recommended), configure CORS:

```nginx
# Nginx
add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*";
add_header Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, OPTIONS";
```

**Best Practice:** Serve workers from the same origin to avoid CORS issues.

### 4. Content Security Policy (CSP)

If using CSP headers, ensure workers are allowed:

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
      content="worker-src 'self';">
```

Or in HTTP headers:
```
Content-Security-Policy: worker-src 'self';
```

### 5. HTTPS Requirement

Web Workers require a **secure context** (HTTPS) in production.

- ‚úÖ Development: `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` are considered secure
- ‚úÖ Production: HTTPS required
- ‚ùå Production HTTP: Workers will fail to load

## Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist before deploying:

- [ ] Worker files copied to `web/workers/` directory
- [ ] At minimum, `*.web.g.dart.js` files present
- [ ] Web server configured to serve `.js`, `.wasm`, `.mjs` correctly
- [ ] CORS headers configured (if needed)
- [ ] CSP allows `worker-src 'self'`
- [ ] Using HTTPS in production
- [ ] Tested in target browsers

## Verification

### Browser Console

Check for these indicators:

**Success:**
```
‚úÖ [WEB WORKER] processSqlSuggestionItems: Completed in 45ms
üöÄ Squadron Platform Type: PlatformType.js
```

**Fallback (workers not loaded):**
```
‚ùå Failed to load worker - falling back to main thread
‚ö†Ô∏è  Workers unavailable, using main thread processing
```

### Developer Tools

1. Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
2. Filter by `workers`
3. Verify worker files are loaded (200 status)
4. Check for CORS or 404 errors

### Test Script

Run this in browser console:

```javascript
// Check if workers directory is accessible
fetch('/workers/suggestion_worker_pool.web.g.dart.js')
  .then(r => console.log('‚úÖ Worker file accessible:', r.status === 200))
  .catch(e => console.error('‚ùå Worker file not found:', e));
```

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Firebase Hosting

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "build/web",
    "rewrites": [{
      "source": "**",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }],
    "headers": [{
      "source": "/workers/**",
      "headers": [{
        "key": "Cache-Control",
        "value": "public, max-age=31536000"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

### Netlify

Create `netlify.toml`:

```toml
[[headers]]
  for = "/workers/*"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000"
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin = "*"
```

### GitHub Pages

Workers should work out of the box. Just ensure files are in `workers/` directory.

### Vercel

Create `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/workers/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Workers Not Loading

**Problem:** Console shows "Failed to load worker"

**Solutions:**
1. Check worker files exist in `build/web/workers/`
2. Verify web server is running and serving files
3. Check browser console for 404 or CORS errors
4. Ensure HTTPS in production

### Performance Not Improved

**Problem:** Workers load but performance is same

**Possible causes:**
1. Dataset too small (< 500 items) - workers have overhead
2. Workers are loading but falling back - check console for errors
3. Browser doesn't support workers

### CORS Errors

**Problem:** "Cross-origin request blocked"

**Solution:**
- Serve workers from same origin as app
- Or configure CORS headers on worker files

### CSP Violations

**Problem:** "Refused to create worker"

**Solution:**
Add to CSP: `worker-src 'self';`

## Fallback Behavior

The package is designed to work without workers:

1. App tries to initialize workers
2. If workers fail to load ‚Üí automatic fallback
3. All functionality works on main thread
4. Slightly slower for large datasets
5. User experience is identical

**This means:** Workers are an **optimization**, not a **requirement**.

## Monitoring

### Production Monitoring

Track worker usage in your analytics:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_code_editor/src/code_field/code_controller/helpers/suggestions/worker_pool_manager.dart';

final health = await WorkerPoolManager.getHealthCheck();
// Send to analytics:
// - health['workersAvailable']
// - health['activeWorkers']
```

### Debug Information

In development, get detailed info:

```dart
final debugInfo = await WorkerPoolManager.getDebugInfo();
print(debugInfo);
// Shows: platform, worker count, initialization status, etc.
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always include worker files** in your deployment
2. **Test on target browsers** before production
3. **Monitor worker availability** in analytics
4. **Cache worker files** for better performance
5. **Use HTTPS** in production
6. **Don't rely on workers** for critical functionality

## Support

If workers don't load:
- The package automatically falls back to main thread
- All features continue to work
- Only performance is affected

For issues, check:
1. Browser console for specific errors
2. Network tab for failed requests

## Summary

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Required for package to work | ‚ùå No (automatic fallback) |
| Improves performance | ‚úÖ Yes (3x faster) |
| Extra deployment steps | ‚úÖ Yes (copy worker files) |
| Complexity | üü° Medium |
